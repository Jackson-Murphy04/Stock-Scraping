Since progress report 1, Jackson has updated the scraping program to two separate programs that scrape data from yahoo and finviz, storing them in an output file. 
I have resolved the issue I was having with selenium, and am now able to run both programs on my computer. Our next steps are to sort and clean the data we have collected, 
implement sentiment analysis, then implement output. We may scrape additional sites for data if we have time remaining after the other steps. As of now Jackson has done
more work, but now that I have resolved my issue I will be able to work more on the next steps.
