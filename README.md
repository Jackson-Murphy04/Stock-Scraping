Project Description:

The software will be a web scraper that extracts stock market news, forum discussions, and sentiment indicators. It will parse data from relevant sources and structure it for further analysis, ultimately providing insights on trending stocks.

Solution Outline:

Web Scraping: Utilize Python (e.g., BeautifulSoup and Selenium maybe others?) to extract data from stock news websites and Reddit forums.

Data Processing: Implement sentiment analysis using a python framework like VADER

 Storage & Output: Store extracted data in some data base

Analysis & Insights: Develop simple analytics to rank stocks based on frequency and sentiment of mentions.

5. Potentially developing a stock trading bot that uses this data to make trades to test the performance of this type of trading strategy?
