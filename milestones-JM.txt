02/22 - 1 hour basic project and idea research
03/18 - 2 hours learning to use selenium and get basic script running
03/18 - 2 hours learning to use beautiful soup and targeting first site yahoo trending 
03/26 - 1 hour lab general bug fixing for first scrape

Task To be Done:
- taget 10+ more sites for scraping and make sure info is pulled
- have all data pulled into a file 
- plan an algorthim to make descisions on what to trade 

How this Challenge went:
The early part of this project has been somewhat challenging but also rewarding as learning a new technology in selenium and beutiful soup in a language that I havent used in a couple of years required a lot of early learning and trial and error. But once I got things up and running I have seen how quickly this code can be adapted to run on multiple taget sites. Obviously going forward I still have some questions about how best I am going to use the data collected to make trading descisions.
