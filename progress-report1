Since challange 7 we have not done much additional work. Overall the project is in a good spot 
and probably needs a couple good weekends of work to finish. We have been able to learn how to use selenium
and beautiful soup and demonstrated how to target a site. From here over the next couple of weeks it 
should be realitively easy to adapt this to other sites we want to target. The main thing we havent started 
doing wuch with is the sentiment anaylsis part once we have a working set of data we should be able to put
start using that. And then from their it will just be about thinking about the best way to display results 
and potentially test it aginst old market data. We have both spent a equal amount of work so far and have not 
run into any main issues.
